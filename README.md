This repository is designed to host various media assets for a website that I helped design for a research project coordinated by Harvard's Georgian Studies Program. 

The "Khachapuri and Fries: A History or the Georgian Diaspora in the US" project has conducted interviews with various prominent members of the Georgian diaspora in the US. 
The project has also collected relevant resources ranging from personal photo albums to Georgian diaspora newspapers.

The website itself is not hosted through Github, but was designed using Omeka.
You can find the Khachipuri and Fries website at https://dccollection.share.library.harvard.edu/georgianstudies/s/gdus/page/about
